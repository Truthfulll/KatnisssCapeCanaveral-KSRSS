KatnisssCapeCanaveral - KSRSS 

Everything here was made by Katniss all I did was edit configs so please check out their other works before downloading. :)

After multiple requests to make something like this I have finally done it with Katniss's newest additions.

Requirements:

Kerbal Konstructs,
OSSNTR,
Tundra SpaceCenter,
Aurora Space Center,
KSRSS Reborn

Incompatibilities:

Rogers Cape Canaveral
SigmaDimensions
Any other KK mod


!!!!! Instructions: Place the Retro/Modern folder into KatnisssCapeCanaveral/Instances !!!!!




Please pick one version that suits you and your play style



If instances dissapear this is usually caused by a mod being installed, always check to make sure nothing is in KerbalKonstructs/NewInstances




Variants:

Retro: 60s - 90s era of Cape Canaveral

Modern: Mid-Late 2020s era of Cape Canaveral
